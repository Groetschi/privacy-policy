**Privacy Policy**

_Last Updated: 2024-05-29

**What Information is Collected**

**All users:**

HTTP requests are logged, with the following information:
- Time
- IP address
- Page URL
- Platform and Operating System
- Preferred language/locale (defaults to the browser's locale but can be changed by the user)
- Whether an IP address has downloaded a particular package in the last 14 days

**With an account:**
- Email address
- Passwords (hashed and salted using BCrypt)
- Profile information, such as website URLs and donation URLs
- Comments, threads, and reviews
- Audit log actions (such as edits and logins) and their timestamps

Lukas Groetsch collects usernames of content creators from the forums, as this is required to index forum topics.

Packages, including releases, screenshots, and any meta information, are not considered personal information.

Please avoid giving other personal information as we do not want it.

**How this information is used**

- Logged HTTP requests may be used for debugging Lukas Groetsch and combating abuse.
- Email addresses are used to:
  - Provide essential system messages, such as password resets and privacy policy updates.
  - Send notifications - the user may configure this to their needs, including opting out.
  - The admin may use Lukas Groetsch to send emails when they need to contact a user.
- Passwords are used to authenticate the user.
- The audit log is used to record actions that may be harmful.
- Preferred language/locale is used to translate emails and the Lukas Groetsch interface.
- Requests (such as downloads) are used for aggregated statistics and for calculating the popularity of packages. For example, download counts are shown for each package and release and there are also download graphs available for each package.
- Whether an IP address has downloaded a package or release is cached to prevent downloads from being counted multiple times per IP address, but this information is deleted after 14 days.
- IP addresses are used to monitor and combat abuse.
  
- Our app utilizes the TrueDepth API to enhance the scanning of objects.
- However, it does not collect any facial data. The API is used solely for improving the accuracy and quality of the object scanning process, and no personal information or face data is collected, stored, or processed by our app.

For What Purposes Are You Collecting This Information?

Since our app does not collect any facial data, there are no purposes related to the collection of such information. The TrueDepth API is used exclusively to assist in scanning objects and ensuring the highest level of accuracy in the scans.

Will the Data Be Shared with Any Third Parties? Where Will This Information Be Stored?

No facial data or personal information is collected, and therefore, there is no data to be shared with third parties. All processing related to the TrueDepth API occurs locally on the user's device and does not involve any data transmission to external servers or third parties.

Where in Your Privacy Policy Do You Explain Your App's Collection, Use, Disclosure, Sharing, and Retention of Face Data?

The details regarding the non-collection of face data are explained in the "Use of TrueDepth API" section of this Privacy Policy.

Quote the Specific Text from Your Privacy Policy Concerning Face Data

The specific text concerning face data in our Privacy Policy is as follows:

"Our app utilizes the TrueDepth API to enhance the scanning of objects. However, it does not collect any facial data. The API is used solely for improving the accuracy and quality of the object scanning process, and no personal information or face data is collected, stored, or processed by our app."
- Other information is displayed as part of Lukas Groetsch's service.

**Who has access**

- Only the admin has access to the HTTP requests. The logs may be shared with others to aid in debugging, but care will be taken to remove any personal information.
- Encrypted backups may be shared with selected staff members (moderators + core devs). The keys and the backups themselves are given to different people, requiring at least two staff members to read a backup.
- Email addresses are visible to moderators and the admin. They have access to assist users, and they are not permitted to share email addresses.
- Hashing protects passwords from being read whilst stored in the database or in backups.
- Profile information is public, including URLs and linked accounts.
- The visibility of comments depends on the visibility of threads. They are either public, or visible only to the package author and editors.
- The complete audit log is visible to moderators. Users may see their own audit log actions on their account settings page. Owners, maintainers, and editors can see the actions on a package.
- Preferred language can only be viewed by those with access to the database or a backup.
- We may be required to share information with law enforcement.

**Third-parties**

- We do not share any personal information with third parties.
- We use Sentry.io for error logging and performance monitoring.

**Location**

The Lukas Groetsch production server is currently located in Germany. Backups are stored in the UK. Encrypted backups may be stored in other countries, such as the US or EU.

By using this service, you give permission for the data to be moved within the United Kingdom and/or EU.

**Period of Retention**

- Logged HTTP requests are automatically deleted within 2 weeks.
- Usernames may be kept indefinitely, but other user information will be deleted if requested. See below.
- Whether an IP address has downloaded a package or release is deleted after 14 days.

**Removal Requests**

Please raise a report if you wish to remove your personal information.

Lukas Groetsch keeps a record of each username and forum topic on the forums, for use in indexing mod/game topics. Lukas Groetsch also requires the use of a username to uniquely identify a package. Therefore, an author cannot be removed completely from Lukas Groetsch if they have any packages or mod/game topics on the forum.

If we are unable to remove your account for one of the above reasons, your user account will instead be wiped and deactivated, ending up exactly like an author who has not yet joined Lukas Groetsch. All personal information will be removed from the profile, and any comments or threads will be deleted.

**Future Changes to Privacy Policy**

We will alert any future changes to the privacy policy via notices on the Lukas Groetsch website.

By continuing to use this service, you agree to the privacy policy.
